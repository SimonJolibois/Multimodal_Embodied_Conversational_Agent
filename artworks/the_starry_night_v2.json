      "description":"Post-Impressionism is an art movement that developed in the late 19th century as a response to Impressionism. It is characterized by a departure from the fleeting light effects and fragmented brushstrokes of Impressionism towards more structured compositions, symbolic content, and greater emotional depth. The movement produced some of the most iconic artists in modern history, including Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cezanne, Georges Seurat, and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec. Post-Impressionist artists emphasized the use of color, light, and texture to create expressive and often symbolic compositions.",

    	 "description":"Impressionism is a style of art that emerged in France in the late 19th century. It is characterized by a focus on capturing fleeting, ephemeral moments, often using loose brushwork and light, bright colors to create a shimmering, atmospheric effect. Impressionist artists sought to capture the sensations and moods of a scene, rather than rendering a detailed, realistic representation of it. Impressionist paintings often depict modern life, including city scenes, leisure activities, and landscapes, and they were often painted quickly and outdoors. Impressionism is seen as a pivotal movement in the development of modern art and had a lasting influence on later movements such as Fauvism and Expressionism."
