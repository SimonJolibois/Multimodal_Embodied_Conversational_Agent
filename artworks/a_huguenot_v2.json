      "description":"Sir John Everett Millais, was an English painter and illustrator who was one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He was a child prodigy who, aged eleven, became the youngest student to enter the Royal Academy Schools. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded at his family home in London. Millais became the most famous exponent of the style, his painting __Christ in the House of His Parents__ in 1850 generating considerable controversy, and he produced a picture that could serve as the embodiment of the historical and naturalist focus of the group, Ophelia, in 1852. By the mid-1850s, Millais was moving away from the Pre-Raphaelite style to develop a new form of realism in his art. His later works were enormously successful, making Millais one of the wealthiest artists of his day, but some former admirers including William Morris saw this as a sell-out (Millais notoriously allowed one of his paintings to be used for a sentimental soap advertisement). While these and early 20th-century critics, reading art through the lens of Modernism, viewed much of his later production as wanting, this perspective has changed in recent decades, as his later works have come to be seen in the context of wider changes and advanced tendencies in the broader late nineteenth-century art world, and can now be seen as predictive of the art world of the present.",

The movement was influenced by the ideals of the Italian Renaissance and rebelled against the formalistic rules of the Royal Academy of Arts. Pre-Raphaelite artists sought to capture spiritual, moral and historical truth through their paintings, often featuring themes from literature, mythology and contemporary life.",

The Pre-Raphaelite movement, of which Millais was a part, was a response to the academic art of the time and sought to revive the techniques and styles of the Renaissance. This painting is considered a masterpiece of this movement and reflects the Pre-Raphaelite__s interest in medieval and Renaissance art, as well as their commitment to realism and truth to nature.",

Millais wanted to refute the say of some who badmouthed the pre-Raphaelite movement of close links with Catholics, so he deliberately designed a painting framing a Protestant.",

He then would have created a detailed underpainting, which served as a base for the final painting.For the final painting, Millais would have used thin, translucent layers of paint to build up the form and texture of the objects and figures in the painting. He would have used a slow-drying medium, such as linseed oil, to allow him to work in layers and build up the paint gradually. He was known for his meticulous attention to detail and his ability to create highly realistic paintings that appear almost photographic. Overall, the creation process for __A Huguenot, on St Bartholomew__s Day__ would have taken several months or longer, as Millais was known for his slow and methodical approach to painting.",
